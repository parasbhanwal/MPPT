# MPPT
Maximum Power Point Tracking using Incremental conductance method
Maximum power point tracking ( MPPT ) technique is used to improve the efficiency of the solar panel.
Maximum power is transferred by the means of imapedence matching ( Source to Load ). 
The solar Panel is a non-linear device , its I-V Characteristics changes w.r.t to incident solar irradiation , hence there is a high need to correct its variations in I-V characteristics.
The MPPT controller use a buck converter to lower the input Voltage ( Solar panel voltage ) and increase output current ( Load current ).
The MPPT that is used in this project is Incremental Conductance Method.
The efficiency of the MPPT device is ~90%.
